### **Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**
An example of an imaging technique that I find inspirational towards the assignment is [this](https://youtu.be/dqVIPuG7mDw?t=1302) After Effects tutorial on creating fractals and applying them to manipulate videos and images. The tutorial demonstrates how fractal patterns can be used to produce visually striking results. In particular, I am drawn to the infinite zooming effect, which creates a sense of depth and motion that feels both abstract and immersive. I would like to recreate this effect, as I can imagine incorporating it into the project regardless of which animation method my group members decide on.
